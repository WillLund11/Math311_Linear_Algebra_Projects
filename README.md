 # Math311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

 This is a repository of projects for the Math 311 Linear Algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

 Projects: 

# 1.) Solve systems using Colab and Python

 Using google colab to introduce the idea of solving systems of equations with code.

 # 2.) Ski Hill Project: Using matricies to determine the how popular certain runs are compared to others.
